  <h2>Abstract</h2>

  <p>We are concerned with the general problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_mining">concept mining</a> &#x2010 discovering useful <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/datamine.111/b28129/market_basket.htm#BABFDDCG">
  associations</a>, </br>
  relationships, and groupings in large collections of data. Mathematical transformation algorithms </br>
  have proven effective at reducing the content of multilingual, unstructured data into a vector that </br>
  describes the content. Such methods are particularly desirable in fields undergoing information </br>
  explosions, such as network traffic analysis, bioinformatics, and the intelligence community. In </br>
  response, concept mining methodology is being extended to improve performance and permit </br>
  hardware implementation &#x2010 traditional methods are not sufficiently scalable. </p> 

  <p>Hardware-accelerated systems have proven effective at automatically classifying such content when </br>
  topics are known in advance. Our complete system builds on our past work in this area, presented </br>
  in the Aerospace 2005 and 2006 conferences, where we described a novel algorithmic approach </br>
  for extracting semantic content from unstructured text document streams.</p>
  
  <p>However, there is an additional need within the intelligence community to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">cluster</a> related sets of </br>
  content without advance training. To allow this function to happen at high speed, we have </br>
  implemented a system that hierarchically clusters streaming content. The method, streaming </br>
  hierarchical partitioning, is designed to be implemented in hardware and handle extremely high </br>
  ingestion rates.</p>

  <p>As new documents are ingested, they are dynamically organized into a hierarchy, which has a fixed </br>
  maximal size. Once this limit is reached, documents must consequently be excreted at a rate </br>
  equaling their ingestion. The choice of documents to excrete is a point of interest - we present </br>
  several autonomous heuristics for doing so intelligently, as well as a proposal for incorporating </br>
  user interaction to focus attention on concepts of interest. </p>
  
  <p>A related desideratum is robust accommodation of concept drift - gradual change in the distribution and </br>
  content of the document stream over time. Accordingly, we present and analyze experimental </br>
  results for document streams evolving over time under several regimes. Current and proposed </br>
  methods for concisely and informatively presenting derived content from streaming hierarchical </br>
  clustering to the user for analysis are presented in this content. </p>

  <p>To support our claims of eventual hardware implementation and real-time performance with a high </br>
  ingestion rate, we provide a detailed hardware-ready design, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis">asymptotic analysis</a> and </br>
  performance predictions. The system has been prototyped and tested on a Xeon processor as well </br>
  as on a PowerPC embedded within a Xilinx Virtex2 FPGA.</p>
  
 <p> In summary, we describe a system designed to satisfy three primary goals: </br>
(1) real-time concept mining of high-volume data streams</br> 
(2) dynamic organization of concepts into a relational hierarchy.</br>
 (3) adaptive reorganization of the concept hierarchy in response to evolving circumstances and user feedback.
